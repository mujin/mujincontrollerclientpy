### How to re-generate `controllergraphclient.py`

First, set up a virtualenv to install required pip packages:

```bash
# create a new virtualenv, you can also delete it afterwards
virtualenv .ve

# install required packages
./.ve/bin/pip install six==1.16.0 requests==2.27.1 pyzmq==22.3.0 graphql-core==3.2.0 typing_extensions==4.2.0

# install mujincontrollerclient
./.ve/bin/pip install .
```

Then, use the `mujin_controllerclientpy_generategraphclient.py` to generate the content of the `controllergraphclient.py` file.

```bash
./.ve/bin/python devbin/mujin_controllerclientpy_generategraphclient.py --url http://controller123 > python/mujincontrollerclient/controllergraphclient.py
